# 1-Code-Refactor

The aim of this project is to make code more professional and to avoid repetitions. By uniting the same lines of code, It's possible to keep the same meaning and at the same time to avoid duplications in CSS stylesheets. Code refactoring helps a developer to understand how to work with similar and the same properties and how to create professional and well-formated tasks. In addition, it makes code easy to read and modify the code if needed.
